/*
Again this function is also same it behaves in a same way how vector and list does
It also allows push_back() and """""""push_front()""""""" but it also allows pop_back() and pop_front() as well.
There is some difference like for a vector the underline data structure that c++ uses is an array
it modifies the array, it uses a dynamic array it does something on the backend and it works for you, 
But for a list and deque the internally thing that work is a doubly   "linked list".
